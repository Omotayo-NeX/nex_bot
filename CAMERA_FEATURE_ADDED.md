# 📸 Camera Feature Added to Receipt Upload!

## ✅ What's New

I've enhanced the **Upload Receipt Modal** in Expensa to support **camera capture** in addition to file upload!

---

## 🎯 New Features

### **1. Take Photo Option**
Users can now choose between:
- **Browse Files** - Upload from device storage (existing)
- **Take Photo** - Capture receipt with device camera (NEW!)

### **2. Camera Interface**
- Live camera preview
- Works on both desktop and mobile
- Automatically uses **back camera** on mobile devices
- Clean capture interface with prominent "Capture Photo" button

### **3. How It Works**

#### **Desktop:**
- Uses webcam if available
- Falls back to file upload if no camera

#### **Mobile:**
- Uses rear-facing camera (environment mode)
- Perfect for snapping receipts on the go
- Captures high-quality JPEG images

---

## 🚀 Usage Flow

1. Click **"Upload Receipt"** on Expensa dashboard
2. Choose **"Take Photo"** button
3. Browser asks for camera permission → Allow
4. Position receipt in frame
5. Click **"Capture Photo"**
6. Photo is automatically processed by AI
7. Review extracted data and submit

---

## 📱 Mobile Experience

The feature is optimized for mobile:
- ✅ Uses back camera by default
- ✅ Full-screen camera view
- ✅ Large, easy-to-tap capture button
- ✅ Responsive UI

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- **Permission-based:** Browser asks for camera permission first
- **No recording:** Only captures single photos, no video
- **Local processing:** Photo stays on device until uploaded
- **Camera stops:** Automatically stops camera after capture

---

## 🐛 Error Handling

If camera access is denied:
- Clear error message displayed
- User can still use "Browse Files" option
- No app crash or freeze

---

## 💡 Technical Details

### **Browser Compatibility**
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (desktop & mobile)
- ✅ Safari (iOS & macOS)
- ✅ Firefox (desktop & mobile)
- ✅ All modern browsers with `getUserMedia` API

### **Camera Selection**
```javascript
facingMode: 'environment' // Prefers back camera on mobile
```

### **Image Format**
- **Format:** JPEG
- **Quality:** 90% (high quality, good compression)
- **Naming:** `receipt-{timestamp}.jpg`
