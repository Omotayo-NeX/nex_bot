# ✅ Expensa Integration - Setup Complete!

## 🎉 Status: Ready for Testing (After Manual Migration)

The Expensa expense tracking module has been fully built and integrated into your NeX AI platform. The development server is running and ready for testing.

---

## 🚀 **Current Status**

✅ **All Code Complete** - 100% implementation done
✅ **Dev Server Running** - http://localhost:3000
⚠️ **Database Migration Needed** - Manual SQL required (Prisma connection pooling issue)

---

## ⚡ **IMPORTANT: Run This First!**

Before testing, you need to create the database tables. Due to Supabase connection pooling issues with Prisma, you'll need to run the migration manually.

### **Option 1: Run SQL Directly in Supabase (Recommended)**

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to: **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file: `MANUAL_MIGRATION.sql` (in your project root)
4. Copy and paste the entire SQL script
5. Click **"Run"**
6. You should see: "Expensa tables created successfully!"

### **Option 2: Try Prisma Again (May Fail)**

```bash
# Wait 5-10 minutes for Supabase connection pool to clear
# Then try:
npx prisma db push
```

---

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

Once the migration is complete, follow these steps:

### **1. Navigate to Expensa**
- Open: http://localhost:3000

## 🐛 **Known Issues & Workarounds**

### **Issue: Prisma Connection Pooling**
**Symptom:** `ERROR: prepared statement "s1" already exists`
**Workaround:** Run SQL manually in Supabase (see above)

### **Issue: Receipt Upload Fails**
**Cause:** Missing `receipts` bucket in Supabase Storage
**Fix:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
2. Create new bucket: `receipts`
3. Make it public for viewing

### **Issue: AI Extraction Not Working**
**Cause:** Missing or invalid OpenAI API key
**Fix:** Check `.env` file has valid `OPENAI_API_KEY` with GPT-4o access
