=== PAGE 3: Core Principles of Modern AI Development ===
AI development rests on key principles:
- Data: High-quality datasets are the foundation of effective models.
- Algorithms: Machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning power AI behavior.
- Feedback Loops: Systems improve with iteration and user interaction.
- Generalization: AI must perform well not just on training data but also on unseen data.
- Safety: Guardrails ensure AI does not produce harmful or biased results.
These principles guide the practical building of applications and agents.

=== PAGE 4: Understanding APIs & AI Service Providers ===
Most modern AI development uses APIs from providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Hugging Face. These APIs expose advanced models like GPT or Claude via simple REST or SDK interfaces. Developers don’t need to train models from scratch—they can integrate existing intelligence into their apps. Choosing a provider depends on cost, speed, model performance, and use case. Self-hosting open-source models like LLaMA or Mistral gives more control but requires more infrastructure.

=== PAGE 5: Setting Up Your Development Environment ===
To build AI apps, a proper environment is essential:
- Install Node.js or Python depending on your stack.
- Use frameworks like React/Next.js for frontend and Express/FastAPI for backend.

- Use version control with GitHub/GitLab.
- Deploy using Vercel, Netlify, or Docker containers.
A clean development workflow ensures maintainability and scalability.

=== PAGE 6: Basics of Prompt Engineering ===
Prompt engineering is the art of designing instructions for AI models. A poorly written prompt can yield vague answers, while a structured prompt can generate precise, valuable output. Tips include:
- Provide context and role (“You are a marketing assistant…”).
- Use examples to guide responses.
- Specify format (JSON, list, bullet points).
- Add constraints (word limit, tone of voice).
Prompt engineering is especially important for agents that must take actions reliably.

=== PAGE 7: Data Handling for AI Systems ===
Data fuels AI applications. Developers must consider:
- Preprocessing: Cleaning and formatting input data.
- Storage: Structured (SQL) vs unstructured (NoSQL, vector databases).
- Retrieval: Using embeddings to fetch relevant knowledge.
- Privacy: Compliance with GDPR/NDPA.
- Security: Encrypting sensitive inputs and outputs.
Robust data handling ensures AI outputs are accurate, secure, and reliable.

=== PAGE 8: Cloud APIs vs Open-Source Models ===
AI applications can be built using either cloud APIs or open-source models:
- Cloud APIs: Easy integration, scalability, pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Open-Source Models: Full control, customizability, no vendor lock-in, but require GPUs and infrastructure.
Hybrid approaches are common—using APIs for general tasks and local models for sensitive or specialized domains.
