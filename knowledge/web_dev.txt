=== PAGE 1: Introduction to Web Development ===
Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves everything from creating simple static websites to complex dynamic platforms. The field is divided into three main areas: frontend development (user interface), backend development (server-side logic), and full-stack development (a combination of both). Modern web development requires knowledge of programming languages, frameworks, databases, security practices, and deployment strategies. As technology evo...

=== PAGE 2: History of the Web ===
The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee. The first websites were static, text-based, and used basic HTML. In the mid-1990s, CSS was introduced to separate content from design. JavaScript soon followed, enabling interactivity. The early 2000s saw the rise of dynamic sites powered by PHP and MySQL. The Web 2.0 era introduced social media, user-generated content, and AJAX. Today, the web is powered by cloud computing, APIs, and frameworks like React, Angular, and Next.js, making sites fast...

=== PAGE 3: Understanding the Internet & Web Servers ===
The internet is a global network of interconnected computers. Websites are hosted on servers, which are specialized computers that deliver content when requested by clients (browsers). Communication happens through protocols like HTTP and HTTPS. Web servers like Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS handle requests and responses. DNS (Domain Name System) translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses. Understanding how servers and the internet work is crucial for effective web development.

=== PAGE 4: HTML Basics ===
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of web pages. It structures content using elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links. Tags define elements, while attributes provide additional information. Example:
```html
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<a href="https://example.com">Click here</a>
```
HTML is not a programming language but a markup language. Mastering its fundamentals is the first step for any aspiring web developer.

=== PAGE 5: Advanced HTML5 Features ===
HTML5 introduced powerful features such as:
- Semantic elements (<header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>).
- Multimedia support (<audio> and <video>).
- Forms with new input types and validation.
- Canvas for 2D graphics and WebGL for 3D rendering.
- Local storage and offline capabilities with service workers.
These features make modern web apps more interactive and functional without relying on plugins.

=== PAGE 6: CSS Fundamentals ===
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the presentation of HTML elements. It defines colors, fonts, layouts, and responsiveness. Core concepts include selectors, properties, and values. Example:
```css
body { font-family: Arial; background: #f5f5f5; }
h1 { color: blue; }
```
CSS separates design from structure, making websites easier to style and maintain. Developers use external, internal, or inline CSS depending on needs.

=== PAGE 7: Responsive Design & Flexbox/Grid ===
Responsive design ensures websites look good on all devices. Media queries allow CSS to adapt to screen sizes. Flexbox simplifies one-dimensional layouts, while CSS Grid handles complex two-dimensional structures. Together, they enable developers to build fluid, mobile-friendly designs. Mobile-first design is now a standard practice, considering that most users access the web on smartphones.

=== PAGE 8: JavaScript Basics ===
JavaScript (JS) is the programming language of the web. It enables interactivity, logic, and dynamic content. Basics include variables, functions, loops, and events. Example:
```js
function greet(name) {
  alert("Hello, " + name);
}
greet("World");
```
JS runs in the browser and interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM). Understanding core JS is essential before moving to frameworks.

=== PAGE 9: DOM Manipulation ===
The DOM (Document Object Model) represents a web page as a tree structure. JavaScript can manipulate the DOM to change content and styles dynamically. Example:
```js
document.getElementById("title").innerText = "Updated Title";
```
DOM manipulation powers interactivity such as dropdown menus, modals, and form validation. Libraries like jQuery once simplified this, but modern JavaScript makes it easier.

=== PAGE 10: ES6+ Modern JavaScript ===
ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced modern features like arrow functions, classes, template literals, and modules. Example:
```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```
Later versions added async/await, optional chaining, and promises. These features make JavaScript cleaner, more powerful, and better suited for complex applications.
